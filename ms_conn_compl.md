# Introduction

- complexity in networks
- degree distribution vs. connectance
- "physical" argument

# Statistical argument

Assuming and ecological network made of $n$ species, and assuming undirected
interactions with no self-edges (*e.g.* no cannibalism), there can be at most
$n(n-1)/2$ interactions in this network, in which case it is a complete graph
(the results presented below hold for both directed graphs, and graphs in which
self-edges are allowed).

- combinations
- no free nodes
- probability to generate a suitable network

# Simulations

- unipartites
- explain the procedure
- give results for average, variance, kurtosis, skewness

# Practical consequences

- null models
- swap
